# Tasks
In these directories you can find tasks that I have resolved on the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures"
## count-inversions directory
The task is to implement bubble sort, insertion sort and modified insertion sort. Also build the graphics to compare time complexity of these algorithms.

## bubble-and-insertion directory
In this task I used modified merge sort to find the inversions number.
### Formal formulation of the problem
Using the decomposition method, develop an algorithm that will solve the next task.

Incoming data. Matrix D of natural numbers of dimension u*m, where u is this quantity users, m is the number of movies. Each element of the matrix D[i, j] indicates a position of the movie j in the list of user i preferences. Another input element is x — user number, with which all other users will be compared.

Output data. A list of pairs (i, c) ordered by the growth of the second element, where i — user number, c — a number that indicates the degree of similarity of preferences of users x and c (number of inversions).

## quick-sort directory
In this task I had to implement three modifications of the Quick Sort algorithm and compare their performance. The speed of the algorithms is compared based on the count of the number of comparisons of the array elements during the operation of the algorithms.

## pyramids directory
The task wat to find medians of given array using Max Heap and Min Heap (pyramids). I had to find it for each current heap size. Class Hlow is an implementation of Max Heap, class Hhigh - Min Heap. After building them if theirs heap sizes were equal the medians were root nodes of each pyramid, otherwise - the root of the pyramid with greater heap size.
